2. Write an SQL query to insert a new enrollment record for a student (e.g., StudentID 5) into the course with the highest credit hours.

ans : INSERT INTO enrollment(StudentID, CourseID, EnrollmentDate) values(2, (SELECT CourseID FROM course where credits =( SELECT MAX(Credits) FROM course)), '2024-02-16')   


3. Write an SQL UPDATE query to assign a new instructor to a course (e.g., CourseID 3) by updating the InstructorID

ans: UPDATE course SET InstructorID = 2 where courseid =2;


4. Write an SQL query to find the names of instructors who teach the most credits (total).

SELECT name, sum(credits) as total_credit FROM course
 join instructor ON course.InstructorID=instructor.InstructorID group by name ORDER BY total_credit DESC  limit 1;


5. Write an SQL query to list all students who are enrolled in more than two courses
ans: SELECT name, count(enrollment.studentid) as total FROM student JOIN enrollment ON student.studentId = enrollment.StudentID 
group by enrollment.studentid having total >2;



7. Explain the difference between GROUP BY and ORDER BY in SQL. Provide an example for each to illustrate.

GROUP BY: Groups rows with the same values in specified columns. Used with aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, etc.

Example:
SELECT Product, SUM(Amount) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY Product;

ORDER BY: Sorts the rows of the result set in ascending or descending order.

Example:
SELECT Product, Amount
FROM Sales
ORDER BY Amount DESC;

8. Given a table Instructor with a Salary column, write an SQL query to find the second-highest salary among instructors
Ans
 SELECT * FROM instructor WHERE salary = (SELECT max(salary) FROM instructor where salary < (SELECT max(salary) FROM instructor));

 9. You have two tables, Instructor and Course. Use ON DELETE CASCADE on Course so that all courses are deleted when an instructor is removed.

 CREATE TABLE Course (
    CourseID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Credits INT NOT NULL,
    InstructorID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (InstructorID) REFERENCES Instructor(InstructorID) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
 
DELETE FROM Instructor WHERE InstructorID = 1;

10. Describe the most challenging topic you encountered in this course. Explain why it was challenging and how you overcame it.

ANS: The most challenging topic I encountered in this exam was when I was working with foreign key constraints 9 number question.  when implementing ON DELETE CASCADE. Initially, I did not add any constraints to the  Course table and also did not set the ON DELETE CASCADE rule. I tried multiple times to update the table but  I faced issues that the foreign key constraint was not in place. After multiple attempts, I realized I had to first add the constraint to the InstructorID column and then set the ON DELETE CASCADE rule. However, I canâ€™t solve this issue with updates, I am creating a new table from scratch, adding the constraint and ON DELETE CASCADE correctly from the beginning. finally worked on this approach and solved the problem.
